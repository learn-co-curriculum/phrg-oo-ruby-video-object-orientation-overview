This video gives a concise introduction to Object Orientation. There may be several concepts that you're unfamiliar with but the subsequent lessons will take a closer look at each of the topics covered and you'll have plenty of practice via labs. 

## Objectives

- Explain how objects are metaphors for real life concepts
- Define a new class with the `class` keyword
- Instantiate instances of the class with the class constructor `new`.
- Add attributes to our instances with setter/getter methods and instance variables
- Use the attr_accessor, attr_reader and attr_writer methods to dynamically create setter and getter methods
- Keep track of all our class' instances with class variables and class methods
- Hook into an object's instantiation with #initialize
- Explain when to use implicit versus explicit receivers
- Define a class find_by_name method to find specific instances
